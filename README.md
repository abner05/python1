 Day 1 
What is python 
	Python is genernal purpose high level programming language 
Who found Python

	1991 ===> DOB :Feb 20th 1991 
 Fisrt language
 ---------

    popular TV show BBC
	
	Monty 
	Python's

	Guido 
 1. Functinal programming from C
 2. OOp from C++
 3. Scripting language features  from perl and shell script 
 4. Modular programming features from Modula-3
    synatx from C language and ABC language 
	
	WHERE WE CAN USE Python
1.Desktop application/Standalone 
2.We applications -->DJango,Flasck 
3.Database applications--
4.Netwoking applications 
5.Games.
6.Data Analysis 
7.Machine Learing
8.AI app
9.IoT applications
------
Mobile -base is not support

Which companies 
google 
youtube
Dropbox
NASA
  use 
   to remove duplicate mobile nos 
   for automation 
   
1.Simple and easy to learn
2.Free ware and open source
3.High level programming language 
4.platform indepeneted 
5.Protablity 
6.dynamicall Type 
7.Both proecdure Oriented and Object oriented  
8.Interpreted 
9.Extensible
   we have some code in java ( 1 lask lines of code ) 
   We can improve performance of the application 
   
10. Embedded 
       we can use python
11. Extensive Library 
build house 
buy house 
 
 Limitiations of Python
 
 1.performance  wise 
 2 mobile applications
 
 Myth; Puthon not suitable for large scale enterprise applications 
 
 Flavors of python
 1.CPython- standard -used to work C language
 2.Jython or Jpython
 3.IronPython - MS c sharp language
 4.Pypy- high performance- PVM -JIT
 5.Ruby python- ruby platform 
 6.AnacondaPython - to handle huge data 
 7.Stackless( python for concurrency) 
 Python versions 
 python 1.0 introduced in Jan 1994
 Python 2.0  Introduced in October 2000
 python 3.0  Interduced in  Dec 2008
 
 python 3.6.3 ==> 2016
 Any new version should provide support  for old version program
 Python -3 python-2 by 2020 shoud support )( should not support )
 print"hello" vaild inPython-2 but invalid in python-3
 long data type ===>python-2 but not in python -3
 
 
 
 


>>> x=10
>>> print(type(x))
<class 'int'>
>>> x=10.5
>>> print(type(x))
<class 'float'>
>>> x=True
>>> print(type(x))
<class 'bool'>
>>>
 
	
	======================
	indentifiers
	what is indentifires:
	name  in program is called indentifires
	     varibale name, class name or method name
Rules to define idenitifiers in Python
------------------------------------------
 1. alphabet symbols ( both upper case and lower case)
    digits (0t9)
	underscore (_)
	cash=10
	ca$H=10
	
2 . identifer should not starts withdigit
   total123=10
    123total=10
